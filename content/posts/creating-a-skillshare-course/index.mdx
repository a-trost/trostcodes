I recently created a Skillshare course all about animating SVG with GreenSock, and it was a really excellent experience. I learned more than I had expected on the day of recording, and I want to help you record the best course you can.

## The Format

I had a specific format I wanted to use that I got from sites like Treehouse. Each lesson looked something like this:

1. The teacher is on camera explaining **the thing we're going to learn** in this lesson and why it's important
2. Cut to screencast where **we learn the thing**
3. Teacher on camera saying that **we learned the thing** and what we're going to learn in the next video

This is different from sites like Egghead, where they try to keep things as succinct as possible and do away with the beginning and end parts.

## My Kit

### Tripod for Stability

I had both cameras mounted on tripods so that the shot was stable and clear. This is a must-have, and you can purchase one for as little as 20 dollars, so make the investment if you don't have a tripod.

### Lights

At the Skillshare office where I filmed, they had lights ready for me to use. If you don't have access to pro-style lights, here's just a few quick tips.

Use “soft light” not direct, harsh light

- Use soft light, not direct light.
- Artificial is better because the sun will change

For next time I just ordered [these lights](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NBP6D98/).

### Camera and Light Setup

I recorded from two angles, one straight on, and another from about a 40 degree angle. Both cameras were set at eye level. The lights were around 6-7 feet off the ground and angled down just slightly.

## Get an Assistant

If you can, I highly recommend getting a friend to help you with recording your course. It will make the entire process so much easier. They don't need to be AV Club members or anything. Most people have some basic camera skills these days, and that'll suffice.

I was so fortunate that my wife came with me to help with shooting.

### Our Recording Process

**This was our process for each lesson:**

1. She hits record on both cameras
2. I deliver the intro to that lesson until we had a few decent takes (This sometimes took a while)
3. She hits stop on both cameras
4. She hits record (2x)
5. I deliver the outro
6. She hits stop (2x)

Without an assistant I'd have to press record, run around the desk, deliver the lines, then run around the desk again to hit stop.

This doesn't seem like a big deal in theory, but has a couple pitfalls. First, it adds 15 seconds of extra footage at the beginning and end of each clip, giving you bigger file sizes and more to edit out.

I'd also shift my chair and body position the more I moved around, so sitting still made it so I wasn't doing jump cuts between takes.

My wife also helped detect camera issues as they were happening, as the DSLR cut off after about 10 minutes of recording.

## Recording Settings

I was under the impression that a higher fps was always good, and so I was set to record at 60fps. Turns out that might not be a great idea.

I was recommended by my editor to shoot in 24 frames per second. Apparently it can look a bit unsettling when you have too many frames, as even super tiny movements are picked up. Not what I'm looking for when I'm just sitting at a desk talking.

Luckily the iPhone XS can shoot at many different settings. If you go into Settings -> Camera -> Record Video you'll see your options for shooting with the standard camera app.

Not sure about Android phones, but I'm sure there's a similar feature on newer models.

We were able to record at 4K at 24fps.

### Filmic Pro

I didn't use the iPhone camera app, but instead an app called Filmic Pro. I've had it for a while, and it has great features like stabilization, focus and exposure lock, and really detailed light temperature controls.

In Filmic Pro I set the ratio to 16:9, as that's what Skillshare expects.

Filmic Pro is probably more than what you need, but I wanted to have specific control over a lot of the video, and I already owned the app, so it was a good choice for me. Highly recommended.

### Using a DSLR

I have a Canon Rebel T3i that I was going to use for my primary camera. My assumption was that the bigger sensor, lens and camera would create a better image. Nope. Here's a comparison:

In hindsight this seems pretty obvious. The T3i came out in 2011 and shoots in 1080p, where the iPhone XS came out in 2018 and shoots in gorgeous 4K. The video feature on T3i feels like an afterthought, not a main feature.

Overall, I'm pretty happy with the image quality from the iPhone, and next time I'll be recording with two iPhones instead of the DSLR.

## Strategy for Recording

This was my first time recording a full course like this, so I definitely had to do some learning on the job.

I had scripts written out for every part, but the goal is to make the viewer feel like you're not just reading or memorizing lines. That's not engaging and your students will stop listening to you if it feels unnatural.

So memorize your lines and do multiple takes, at least one more than the one that ‘seemed fine'. You'll wish you had more takes to choose from in editing.

I had everything I wanted to say written down on the laptop that sat in front of me. It acted as a prop as well as my script, so it worked well.

## Screen Recording

I used Apple Quicktime to record everything, and it was alright. It didn't crash or cause problems but I don't like how the colors came out.

Since then I've been recording most things with OBS, but I've heard good things about ScreenFlow.

### Toolbar Tidying

I recommend Vanilla to cover up EVERYTHING in the toolbar. Editing cuts that would have been invisible get way more dramatic when you see the time in the top right corner jump ahead 5 minutes.

Instead of viewers seeing this:

They see this:

It's all about cutting back on distractions for your students, and big time jumps or curious taskbar icons are only distractions.

You could also remove the toolbar by only recording smaller than full-screen.

### Do Not Disturb

Also make sure you put on Do not Disturb on your computer. On Mac it's tucked away in the side panel.

This advice also carries over well to streaming, if that's something you're interested in.
