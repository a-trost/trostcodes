## 1:1 Meetings

Here are some of my favorite questions to get the conversation moving:
Identify: These questions focus on what really matters for your report and what topics are worth spending more time on.

- What's top of mind for you right now?
- What priorities are you thinking about this week?
- What's the best use of our time today?

Understand: Once you've identified a topic to discuss, these next questions get at the root of the problem and what can be done about it.

- What does your ideal outcome look like?
- What's hard for you in getting to that outcome?
- What do you really care about?
- What do you think is the best course of action?
- What's the worst-case scenario you're worried about?

Support: These questions zero in on how you can be of greatest service to your report.

- How can I help you?
- What can I do to make you more successful?
- What was the most useful part of our conversation today?

## Giving Feedback

### What does great feedback look like?

Feedback doesn't have to be critical.

Praise is often more motivating than criticism.

You don't have to start with a problem.

Early on set clear expectations and establish the feedback process.

Address:

- What a great job looks like for the report, vs mediocre or bad
- What advice you have to help your report get started on the right foot
- Common pitfalls your report should avoid

Example given:

<SimpleCard>

In your first three months on the job, I expect that you'll build good relationships with your team, be able to ramp up on a small-scale “starter” project, and then share your first design iteration for review. I don't expect that you'll get the green light on it right away, but if you do, that would be knocking it out of the park.

Here's what success looks like for the next meeting you run: the different options are framed clearly, everyone feels like their point of view is well represented, and a decision is made.

Frequent feedback is key.

Your report should have a clear sense at all times of what your expectations
are and where he stands. If he is often wondering, What does my manager think
of me? then you need to dial up your level of feedback.

### Give Task specific feedback as frequently as you can

After a task is performed or presented, tell them what they did well and what can be improved.

This makes the feedback less about them as a _person_ and more about the task that was performed.

<SimpleCard>

That research report you shared yesterday was excellent. The way you succinctly summarized the most important findings at the top made it easy to process. The particular insight about X was really useful.

Quick note about the presentation you gave this morning: I noticed you went straight to the proposal without explaining how you got there. This made it hard to assess why it was the best path. Next time, try spending a few minutes walking through your process and what alternatives you considered.

### Share Behavioral Feedback thoughtfully and regularly

Through multiple task-specific feedback sessions, what themes start to emerge about a report?

Do they make decisions quick/slow? Are they more into perfecting a process or think unconventionally? Do they prefer pragmatic or idealistic solutions?

Asking these questions about themes reveals a report's strengths or areas for development.

Behavioral feedback is broader than task feedback, and can be used to connect dots across multiple examples. With it, you can help people understand how their unique interests, personalities, and habits affect their work.

Be careful with behavioral feedback, as it's a statement about the _person_. Consider your words carefully and use specific examples to explain the opinion you're sharing.

Behavioral feedback helps because it lets others know how they're perceived, which is often difficult to know. They gain a deeper understanding of themselves and how they can be most effective.

<SimpleCard>

When people ask you questions about your work, your tone is often defensive. For example, when Sally left a comment on your code, you replied with “just trust me.” This disregarded the substance of her feedback and made you appear less trustworthy.

Your recruiting skills are top-notch. Candidates often say they leave a conversation with you feeling more inspired than when they began. You also have a keen sense for suggesting the right people for the right roles. For example, you identified John for Project X a year ago, and now he's thriving.

### Collect 360-Degree feedback for maximum objectivity

Can ask "Would you be comfortable sharing that feedback with X?" This removes a distortion as being the middleman.

### Your feedback only counts if it makes things better

- Am I giving Feedback Often enough?
  - Give it more often and remind yourself you're probably not giving it enough.
  - Every time you see a report in action see if there's something useful you can tell her.
  - Give task feedback AND feedback related to skills and career trajectory
  - If behavioral feedback is low, devote a single 1:1 only to that kind of feedback
- Is my feedback being heard?
  - What you say isn't always what someone hears.
  - If the recipient views the conversation as a 'threat' it'll trigger a stress response.
  - Make sure the listener feels safe and that you care about them and their success
  - Don't try to be right, judge them, or show you're annoyed or angry. It undercuts the message
  - Positive feedback is very effective.
  - When you have critical feedback to share, be curious about their perspective.
    - "Does this feedback resonate with you? Why or why not?"
    - If yes, it's more likely to stick. If no, that's okay and we discuss why.
  - To make sure you're heard:
    - Verbal confirmation
    - Summarize via email
    - Help them hear the same feedback many times from many sources.
- Does my feedback lead to positive action?
  - If they don't know what to do with the feedback it's not helpful.

### Three tips to make feedback successful

1. Make your feedback as specific as possible

2. Clarify what success looks and feels like

3. Suggest next steps
