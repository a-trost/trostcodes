Great managers discover what is unique about each person and utilize it. They know and value their unique abilities and even eccentricities. Managers challenge each person to excel in their own way.

Anecdote about a report who performed poorly when give vague assignments, but performed well with specific tasks requiring precision. Because of this, his role, and the way the store operated, was changed to suit his strengths.

The manager goes on to see other employees with different talents and adjusts the way the store runs to utilize their unique talents. The writer points out that these configurations don't last forever and everything is in flux, and that's alright.

Another employee who was very numbers-driven was encouraged when her manager started putting sales figures on the wall, highlighting the best numbers.

No employee, however talented, is perfectly well-rounded. You're always going to need to find strengths and weaknesses, and utilize appropriately.

Why capitalizing on each person's uniqueness is tremendously powerful:

1. It saves time.
2. It makes each person more accountable to those specific things.
3. It builds a stronger sense of team and creates interdependency.
4. Healthy disruption. People aren't siloed to their 'role' but have the freedom to make impact where they can.

More important than business outcomes is finding the special characteristics in each person, empowering them, and helping them grow.

## What to know about each direct report

1. What are their strengths?
2. What are the triggers that activate those strengths?
3. What is their learning style? (This one makes me skeptical, but I'll try to hold judgement)

### Making the most of strengths

Two ways to find this: "What is the best day at work you've had in the past three months?"
Strengths aren't just things they're good at, but could be something they're not good at _yet_. It could be just something they find satisfying and are curious about. Strengths could be something they want to develop but haven't had the chance.
