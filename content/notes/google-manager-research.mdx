Google did research on managers at Google and found that teams with great managers are happier and more productive.

They asked employees about their managers and also interviewed the managers to figure out what they were doing. They came away with 10 Good Manager Behaviors.

## Google Manager Behaviors

1. Is a good coach
2. Empowers team and does not micromanage
3. Creates an inclusive team environment, showing concern for success and well-being
4. Is productive and results-oriented
5. Is a good communicator - listens and shares information
6. Supports career development and discusses performance
7. Has a clear vision/strategy for the team
8. Has key technical skills to help advise the team
9. Collaborates across the company
10. Is a strong decision maker.

This is a great list, and it's safe to say I'm weak in quite a few of these skills, so there's lots of room for improvement.

It's important to note that yes, this research is by Google, for Google, and might not fit my company perfectly. Still, the overall findings should be evaluated and considered. It's as good a framework as any to aim towards.
